// Example of Observer pattern.
// This Tracker is instantiated at beginning of game and active till end.
// It subscribes for the following published events
// and maintain a data structure in memory for game status:
//  - adventurer and creature enter a room
//  - adventure/creature wins/loses combat
//  - adventurer celebrates
//  - adventurer/creature defeated/removed
//  - treasure found by adventurer

// Subscribers of the Tracker are:
//  Rooms (auto-updates their Character/Creature/Treasure occupancy),
// the Logger,
// and the Printer.

// At first we tried to implement the Observer pattern with
// an Observer interface,
// but are using references in method calls
// Decision informed from "Game Programming Patterns"
// a book by Robert Nystrom http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html
// "A more modern approach is for an “observer” to be only a reference to a
// method or function.
// In languages with first-class functions, and especially ones with closures,
// this is a much more common way to do observers.""
